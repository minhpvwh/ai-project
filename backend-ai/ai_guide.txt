            Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on 
            algorithms that can learn from data. There are three main types:
            
            1. Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled training data
            2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
            3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with environment
            
            Popular algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, 
            neural networks, and support vector machines.
